# 🎮 2D RPG Engine - Complete Project Summary

## ✅ WHAT YOU NOW HAVE

A **fully functional 2D top-down RPG game engine** like Zelda/Pokemon, built to teach polymorphism!

### Game Features
- ✅ **Top-down movement** with WASD/Arrow keys
- ✅ **Tile-based maps** (16x12 grid, 48x48 pixel tiles)
- ✅ **Collision detection** (walls, obstacles, water)
- ✅ **Enemy encounters** (walk into them)
- ✅ **Pokemon-style turn-based battles** with health bars
- ✅ **Visual battle screen** with sprites
- ✅ **Player stats** (HP, Attack, Defense, Level, EXP, Gold)
- ✅ **60 FPS smooth gameplay**
- ✅ **Real-time health bar** display

## 🎯 How It Teaches Polymorphism

### The Core Pattern
Each student creates a **level class** that extends `GameLevel`:
```
GameLevel (abstract)
├── ForestLevel (example)
├── CaveLevel (example)
└── Student1_Level, Student2_Level, etc.
```

### Polymorphism in Action
```java
// In Main2D.java - engine doesn't care which level!
GameLevel level = new ForestLevel();     // Could be ANY level
gamePanel.setLevel(level);               // Works the same

// Later - switch to different student's level
gamePanel.setLevel(new CaveLevel());     // Still works!
gamePanel.setLevel(new VolcanoLevel());  // Polymorphism!
```

**Key Point:** Engine calls `setupMap()` and `setupEnemies()` the same way for ALL levels, even though each has totally different implementation!

## 🚀 Quick Start

### For Teachers - Try It Now
```batch
compile-2d.bat
run-2d.bat
```

### For Students - Create Your Level
1. Copy `STUDENT_TEMPLATE_2D.java` to `src/levels/YourName_Level.java`
2. Design your map in `setupMap()`
3. Place enemies in `setupEnemies()`
4. Define tile colors in `getTileColor()`
5. Test and adjust!

## 🎨 What Students Can Customize

### Map Design
- **16x12 tile grid** to design
- **Tile types** (grass, walls, water, custom)
- **Colors** for each tile type
- **Layout** - rooms, paths, obstacles
- **Theme** - forest, cave, desert, volcano, ice, etc.

### Enemies
- **Custom sprites** (draw with code or load images)
- **Stats** (health, attack, defense)
- **Battle AI** (attack patterns, special moves)
- **Rewards** (EXP and gold)

### Example Themes
- 🌲 Forest Zone
- 🗻 Cave System
- 🌋 Volcano Level
- ❄️ Ice Caverns
- 🏜️ Desert Temple
- 🏰 Castle Dungeon
- 🌊 Underwater Zone
- ⚡ Electric Factory

## 🎓 Educational Value

### Polymorphism Concepts
1. **Abstract classes** - `GameLevel`, `Enemy`
2. **Method overriding** - `setupMap()`, `performBattleAction()`
3. **Dynamic binding** - Engine calls correct version at runtime
4. **Code reusability** - One engine, many levels
5. **Collaborative design** - Multiple students, one game

### Additional Learning
- 2D graphics and rendering
- Game loops (update/render cycle)
- Collision detection algorithms
- Event-driven programming (keyboard input)
- Tile-based map systems
- Turn-based combat systems

## 🎮 Game Mechanics

### Exploration Phase
- **Move with WASD/Arrows** - 4-directional movement
- **Speed:** 4 pixels per frame
- **Collision:** Can't walk through solid tiles
- **Enemies:** Visible on map, trigger battle on contact

### Battle Phase
- **Turn-based:** Player acts first, then enemy
- **Actions:**
  - **Fight** - Deal damage based on attack stat
  - **Run** - 50% chance to escape
- **Damage formula:** `damage = attacker.attack - defender.defense` (min 1)
- **Victory:** Gain EXP and gold, enemy removed from map
- **Defeat:** Return to exploration (could add respawn later)

### Progression
- **Level up** when EXP threshold reached
- **Stats increase** on level up (+20 HP, +5 ATK, +2 DEF)
- **Gold** accumulates from battles
- **Health bar** shows current HP

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Display
- **Resolution:** 768x576 pixels (16x12 tiles @ 48px each)
- **Frame rate:** 60 FPS
- **Window:** JFrame with double buffering

### Coordinate System
- **World coordinates:** Absolute positions in pixels
- **Tile coordinates:** Grid positions (0-15 x, 0-11 y)
- **Collision box:** 32x32 pixels (smaller than sprite for better feel)

### Controls
```
Movement:
  W or ↑  - Move up
  A or ←  - Move left
  S or ↓  - Move down
  D or →  - Move right

Battle:
  SPACE or ENTER - Confirm action
  ← →            - Select action (Fight/Run)
```

## 📞 Support

### If Something Doesn't Work
1. Check compilation errors carefully
2. Verify all files are in correct folders
3. Make sure package names match folder structure
4. Test with example levels first

### Common Issues
- **Can't move:** Check collision detection isn't too strict
- **No enemies:** Verify `setupEnemies()` is called
- **Blank screen:** Check rendering code in level
- **Battle won't end:** Make sure health goes to 0
