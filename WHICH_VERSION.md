# Which Version Should I Use? 🤔

This project has **TWO versions** - choose the one that fits your needs!

## 📟 Console Version (Original)

**Files:** `Main.java`, `Level.java`, console examples

### ✅ Use Console Version If:
- You want simpler code
- Students are new to Java
- Focus is purely on polymorphism concepts
- You don't want to teach GUI/callbacks
- Quick to understand and implement

### 📝 Pros:
- Simpler code flow (sequential)
- Easier to debug
- Less concepts to learn
- Traditional programming style

### 📝 Cons:
- Text-only interface
- Less engaging visually
- No real-time stat display

### 🚀 How to Run:
```
compile.bat
run.bat
```

### 📖 Documentation:
- `README.md` - Main documentation
- `STUDENT_TEMPLATE.java` - Student template
- `STUDENT_QUICKSTART.md` - Quick guide

## 🎮 GUI Version (Swing)

**Files:** `MainGUI.java`, `LevelGUI.java`, GUI examples

### ✅ Use GUI Version If:
- You want a visual, modern interface
- Students are comfortable with Java basics
- You want to teach event-driven programming
- You want to cover callbacks/lambdas
- More engaging for students

### 📝 Pros:
- Beautiful visual interface
- Real-time stats display
- More engaging for students
- Teaches additional concepts (callbacks, events)
- Professional-looking result

### 📝 Cons:
- More complex code structure
- Requires understanding callbacks
- Harder to debug
- More concepts to learn

### 🚀 How to Run:
```
compile-gui.bat
run-gui.bat
```

### 📖 Documentation:
- `README_GUI.md` - GUI documentation
- `STUDENT_TEMPLATE_GUI.java` - GUI template
- Example levels show callback patterns

## 🤷 Still Not Sure?

### For Most Classes: **Start with Console**
- Easier to learn
- Focus on polymorphism
- Less overwhelming

### For Advanced Classes: **Use GUI**
- More impressive result
- Covers more concepts
- Better final product

### Best of Both: **Start Console, Then GUI**
1. Teach polymorphism with console version
2. Convert one level to GUI to show differences
3. Let students choose which to use

## 💡 Teacher's Recommendation

### First-Time Teaching This Project?
→ **Use Console Version**

### Taught It Before?
→ **Try GUI Version**

### Have Mixed-Skill Class?
→ **Offer Both as Options**

### Want Maximum Learning?
→ **Console First, GUI Later**

---

## 🎯 Both Versions Teach:

✅ Polymorphism (main goal!)
✅ Inheritance
✅ Abstract classes
✅ OOP design
✅ Collaborative coding

The **core learning objective is the same** - choose based on your class needs!
