# 🎮 APCS Turn-Based RPG Engine - Project Overview

## What Is This?

A **complete, working turn-based RPG framework** built in Java to teach polymorphism through collaborative game development.

## The Concept

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│          One Game Engine                │
│  (Treats all levels the same way)       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
                    ↓
    ┌───────────────┼───────────────┐
    ↓               ↓               ↓
┌─────────┐   ┌─────────┐   ┌─────────┐
│Student 1│   │Student 2│   │Student 3│
│  Level  │   │  Level  │   │  Level  │
└─────────┘   └─────────┘   └─────────┘

         POLYMORPHISM IN ACTION!
```

## Key Features

### ✅ Complete Game Engine
- Turn-based combat system
- Player progression (levels, stats, inventory)
- Item system
- Enemy AI framework
- Level management

### ✅ Polymorphic Architecture
- Abstract `Level` class - students extend this
- Abstract `Enemy` class - for custom enemies
- Abstract `Item` class - for custom items
- Abstract `Entity` class - base for all characters

### ✅ Example Content
- 2 complete example levels (Forest, Cave)
- 2 example enemies (Goblin, Orc)
- 2 example items (Health Potion, Strength Potion)
- Fully commented code

### ✅ Student Resources
- `STUDENT_TEMPLATE.java` - Copy-paste starting point
- `STUDENT_QUICKSTART.md` - Easy guide for students
- Clear examples to learn from
- Helper methods included

### ✅ Teacher Resources
- `TEACHER_GUIDE.md` - Complete teaching plan
- Grading rubric
- Discussion questions
- Extension ideas
- Week-by-week lesson plan

### ✅ Easy to Use
- `compile.bat` - One-click compilation (Windows)
- `run.bat` - One-click run (Windows)
- Clear error messages
- Well-documented code

```

## How Students Use It

1. **Copy template** → Create their own level file
2. **Extend Level class** → Implement `start(Player player)` method
3. **Add content** → Story, enemies, items, choices
4. **Test** → Add to Main.java and run
5. **Submit** → Teacher integrates all levels

## How Teachers Use It

1. **Teach polymorphism** using the code as examples
2. **Assign project** to students
3. **Collect levels** from students
4. **Integrate** by adding to Main.java
5. **Play together** as a class!

## What Makes This Special

### 🎯 Teaches Real Polymorphism
Not just theory - students see it working in a real project

### 🤝 Collaborative
Everyone's code works together seamlessly

### 🎨 Creative
Students design unique levels with their own style

### 🎮 Fun
It's a real game that actually plays!

### 📚 Educational
Covers key AP CS concepts in a practical way

## Technical Highlights

### Polymorphism Examples

```java
// 1. The engine accepts ANY Level subclass
public void addLevel(Level level) {
    levels.add(level);
}

// 2. Different implementations, same interface
for (Level level : levels) {
    level.start(player);  // Calls correct version!
}

// 3. Students create unique implementations
public class MyLevel extends Level {
    @Override
    public void start(Player player) {
        // Student's unique code here
    }
}
```

### Inheritance Hierarchy

```
Entity (abstract)
├── Player (concrete)
└── Enemy (abstract)
    ├── Goblin (concrete)
    ├── Orc (concrete)
    └── Student_Enemy (concrete)

Item (abstract)
├── HealthPotion (concrete)
└── Student_Item (concrete)

Level (abstract)
├── ForestLevel (concrete)
├── CaveLevel (concrete)
└── Student_Level (concrete)
```

## Quick Start

### Run the Example Game
```powershell
compile.bat
run.bat
```

### For Students
1. Read `STUDENT_QUICKSTART.md`
2. Copy `STUDENT_TEMPLATE.java`
3. Create your level!

### For Teachers
1. Read `TEACHER_GUIDE.md`
2. Review example code
3. Plan your lesson

## Success Criteria

A successful implementation will have:

✅ Students understanding polymorphism conceptually
✅ Working levels from all students
✅ One cohesive game everyone can play
✅ Students excited about coding
✅ Clear demonstration of OOP principles

## Common Use Cases

### In Class
- End-of-year project for AP CS A
- Unit project on polymorphism
- Collaborative coding exercise
- Portfolio piece

### For Students

- See how their code integrates with others
- Creative expression through programming
- Resume-worthy project

### For Teachers
- Reusable every year with new students
- Clear grading criteria
- Engaging way to teach abstract concepts
- Minimal setup required

## Next Steps

### For This Year
1. ✅ Framework is complete and tested
2. ⏭️ Teacher reviews the guides
3. ⏭️ Introduce to class
4. ⏭️ Students create levels
5. ⏭️ Integrate and play!

### Future Enhancements
